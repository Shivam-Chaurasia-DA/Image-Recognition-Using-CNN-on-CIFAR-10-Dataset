# Image-Recognition-Using-CNN-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
I had the opportunity to work on an Image Recognition project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project aimed to develop a model capable of classifying images into ten categories, including animals and vehicles, leveraging the robust capabilities of CNNs for feature extraction and image classification.
